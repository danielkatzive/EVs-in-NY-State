  <p>
Electric vehicles (EVs) are often touted as an important step towards moving to a less carbon-intensive future. However, EVs still represent a small fraction of cars on the road. Moreover, in New York State, ownership is concentrated downstate, where more residents use public transportation and incomes are higher. Upstate counties have lower rates of ownership, despite higher dependency on cars. </p>

  <p> Marc Geller, spokesperson for the <a href="https://www.myeva.org">Electric Vehicle Owners Association of America</a>, says “wealthier areas tend to be the first to adopt EVs because they are more expensive or perceived to be more expensive.” He also points out most Americans buy cars used. EVs are too new to have a strong pipeline of used vehicles and tax rebates are often not available to used vehicle buyers. He expects adoption to spread as the used car market deepens and advocates states making rebates available to used buyers, perhaps closing the upstate/downstate gap over time.</p>
